# TaskManager
## Django Advanced API for task management

I've builded a RESTful API for a task management application. The application allows users to **create, read, update, and delete tasks**. Each task should have a title, description, status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed), and a due date. Additionally, users should be able to register, log in, and associate tasks with their accounts. Ensure that the API follows best practices, is secure, and well-documented.
## Requirements:
### Authentication and Authorization:
- Implement user registration and login functionality using Django's built-in authentication system or a third-party package like Django Rest Framework (DRF) Token Authentication.
- Ensure that only authenticated users can create, update, and delete their own tasks.
- Implement role-based access control: Users should only be able to view and manage their tasks.
### Task Management:
- Create API endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Include validation to ensure that task data is complete and valid.
- Implement filtering, sorting, and pagination for task lists.
- Implement search functionality to allow users to search for tasks based on title, description, or due date.
### API Documentation:
- Generate comprehensive API documentation using tools like Django Rest Swagger or DRF's built-in documentation.
- Include information on how to authenticate and use the API effectively.
## Testing:
- Write unit tests for your API views and serializers.
- Write integration tests to ensure the API functions as expected.
- Implement test coverage to ensure that your tests cover a significant portion of your code.
### Security:
- Implement proper security measures to protect against common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., CSRF protection, authentication/authorization checks, input validation).
- Use appropriate libraries or techniques to prevent SQL injection and other security risks.



- Implement token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse.
